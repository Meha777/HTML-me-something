    <p>It was in July 2009 when we, a family of three, decided to take 
    a trip to Washington D.C. We didn't explore much since we arrived in America in February 2005. 
    I still remember the day we arrived in America, 
    flying straight from Frankfurt, Germany, to Detroit, and then to St.Louis Lambert International 
    Airport. Since it was too cold on the day we arrived
    we didn't see much other than exploring along highway 
    170 traveling south to our friend's home. We woke up the next morning and looked outside through 
    the window, and everything was covered with snow. </p>

    <p>About four years later in 2009 we decided to travel in our small compact car, with our seven month old son,
     all the way to Washington D.C.&nbsp; - the political capital of the United States of America. We printed out google 
     map driving direction, and 
    studied important exits before hitting the road.We didn't
     have GPS with us, and our phone w as also not GPS capable. The driving direction printed on a page of paper
     was our only guide from St.Louis all the way to D.C.
    The trip was full of fun until we started driving at night when we got close to 
     west verginia. We continued driving at night from west verginia all the way to 
     D.C. The foggy weather conditions in west verginia 
    made our trip very difficult and scary at times coupled with
     the darkness of the night.We couldn't clearly 
     see the winding mountain road. On top of that it was our first time to travel on that road. 
     We were lucky to be alive.</p>

    <p>The good news was that
    once we got to Washington D.C. we were able to 
    rest and relax,and we visited some places:
    the Washigton Monument, and some 
    Parks. And of course, my
    wife also loved shopping for new clothes and eating at busy restaurants.Our son enjoyed the parks. 
    On our return trip we had much more fun as we planned 
    not to drive at night. Instead we made it into two day 
    trip with stay over in Columbus, Ohio. Overall it was a great expedition for us at that time.</p>

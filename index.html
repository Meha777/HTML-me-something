<body>It was in July 2009 when we as a family decided to 
    take a trip to Washington D.C. We didn't explore 
    much since we arrived in America in February 2005. 
    <br>I still remember the day we arrived in America, 
    flying from Frankfurt  to Detroit and then to St.Louis Lambert International 
    Airport.<br> Since it was too cold on the day we arrived
    we didn't see much other than exploring along highway 
    170 traveling south to our friend's home. <img>
    <br> <br>Jumping back the story of our trip to DC 
    in 2009 we decided to travel in our small compact car.
    <br> We printed out google map driving direction and 
    studied important exits before starting, as we didn't
     have GPS with us and our phone was also not GPS capable. 
   <br> The trip was fun until we started driving at night 
     in west verginia and then verignia, all the way to 
     D.C. in the morning around 6am.<br>
    The foggy weather conditions in west verginia 
    made our trip very difficult and scary coupled with
     the darkness of the night.<br>We couldn't clearly 
     see the winding of the road due to the fog coupled
    with having no prior experience travelling on the
     road in the area.We were lucky to be alive.<br><br>The good news is that
    once we got to Washington D.C. we were able to 
    rest and relax,and we visited some places:
    the White House,the Washigton Monument, and some 
    Parks.<br>
    My wife also liked shopping and eating at restaurants. 
    On our return trip we had much more fun as we planned 
    not to drive at night. Instead we made it into two day 
    trip with stayover in Columbus, Ohio. Overall it was a great expedition for us at that time.</body>
